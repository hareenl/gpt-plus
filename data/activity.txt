This code generates an image using OpenAI's DALLÂ·E API. It requires an API key which needs to be added in the "YOUR_API_KEY" part of the code. The code sends a POST request to the API endpoint with a prompt, model, number of images to generate, size of image and response format. It then processes the response and retrieves the image URL. The generated image URL is printed at the end.
